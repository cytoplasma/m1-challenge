# Module 1 Challenge

## Description

The main goal of this Module 1 Challenge personally, was to strengthen my sense for debugging & optimizing code using the minimum amount of lines. Within this project, I was able to do just that, along with learning techniques for efficiency such as: editing multiple lines of code at once, utilizing keybinds/macros, and honing my organizational skills
